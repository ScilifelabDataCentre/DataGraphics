<p>
  DataGraphics is a system for serving static datasets and displaying
  graphics (plots, charts) based on the datasets. It uses
  <a href="{{ constants.VEGA_LITE_URL }}">Vega-Lite</a>, a JavaScript
  library for specifying graphics using a high-level grammar in JSON.
</p>
<p>
  There are two types of objects in the system:
  <a href="{{ url_for('about.documentation', page='dataset') }}">dataset</a>
  and
  <a href="{{ url_for('about.documentation', page='graphic') }}">graphic</a>.
  A graphic displays the data from a dataset. There may be more than
  one graphic for each dataset.
</p>
<p>
  A user account is required to create and edit datasets and
  graphics. Datasets and graphics that have been set as public can be
  viewed by anyone without logging in to the system. A user account
  may have the role admin, which permits the user to view all entities
  in the system.
<p>
  Every dataset and graphic is owned by one and only one user account.
  The user may set a dataset or graphic as public (anyone may view) or
  private (only the owner and the admins may view). Only the owner of
  a dataset and graphic (and the admins) may create, edit or delete
  the entities.
</p>
<p>
  There is an API which allows datasets and graphics to be created and
  manipulated programmatically.
