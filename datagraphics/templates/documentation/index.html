  DataGraphics is a system for serving static <strong>datasets</strong>
  and displaying <strong>graphics</strong> (plots, charts) that visualize
  the datasets. It uses
  <a href="{{ constants.VEGA_LITE_URL }}">Vega-Lite</a>,
  a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>
  library for specifying graphics using a high-level grammar in
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a>.

<h4 class="ml-5">Dataset</h4>
<p>
  A dataset contains data as well as some metadata describing it. It
  is owned by a user account.
</p>
<p>
  The data in a dataset consists of a list of records, where each
  record contains key-value pairs. The data is homogenous: Each record
  has the same fields corresponding to the same keys. The values
  corresponding to the same key in different records must have the
  same datatype.
</p>
<p>
  The datatypes allowed for the values in a record are the simple
  datatypes in <a href="https://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a>:
  <ul>
    <li>integer</li>
    <li>number</li>
    <li>boolean</li>
    <li>string</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  The keys and the datatypes of the corresponding values are
  determined automatically from the data when is first loaded into a
  dataset. This metadata cannot be changed once defined for a dataset.
</p>
<p>
  The data contents can be downloaded from, and uploaded to, the
  dataset
  as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a>
  or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a>. When
  updating the data contents, the new data must have the same fields
  and types as the previous data; it is not possible to change this
  for a dataset by uploading differently structured data.
</p>
<p>
  A dataset is static in the sense that the data contents does not
  change unless explicitly updated by uploading data to it. It is not
  possible to edit or delete single records in a dataset; the update
  operation sets the entire data contents.
</p>
<p>
  The metadata of a dataset consists of a title, a description
  (optionally using Markdown), information about the fields of the
  data such as type and whether null values are present, and min, max,
  mean, median, stdev, as appropriate. The title and description can
  be edited by the owner, while the other metadata is set by the
  system.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, each field is tagged with the Veg-Lite encoding types
  applicable for it:
  <ul>
    <li>quantitative</li>
    <li>temporal</li>
    <li>ordinal</li>
    <li>nominal</li>
    <li>geojson</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4 class="ml-5">Graphic</h4>
<p>
  A graphic is a visualization of a dataset. It is owned by a user
  account. A dataset can be visualized by any number of graphic items.
</p>
<p>
  A graphic is created for a specific dataset, which cannot be changed.
</p>
<p>
  A graphic can have a different owner than the dataset it
  uses. However, if the dataset becomes inaccessible for the owner of
  the graphics for some reason (the dataset is deleted by its owner,
  or is made private), the visualization of the graphic will no longer
  be viewable.
</p>
<p>
  Since a graphic refers to its dataset by a URL, changing the dataset
  will change the content of the graphic visualization.
</p>
<p>
  The specification of the visualization is written using the
  <a href="{{ constants.VEGA_LITE_URL }}">Vega-Lite</a> high-level
  grammar. For more information on it, follow the link.

<h4 class="ml-5">Access rights</h4>
<p>
  Currently, the access rights system is based on a very simple model
  where an item can have one of two possible access settings:
  <ul>
    <li> A <strong>private</strong> (the default) item can be viewed
      only by the owner of it.
    </li>
    <li>A <strong>public</strong> item can be viewed by anyone,
      including anonymous (not logged-in) users.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Regardless of private/public setting, an item can be created, edited
  and deleted <strong>only</strong> by its owner.
</p>
<p>
  The access setting of dataset or a graphic can be changed by its
  owner.
</p>

<h4 class="ml-5">User account</h4>
<p>
  A user account in the system is required to create and edit datasets
  and graphics. A dataset and graphic is always owned by one and only one
  user account.
</p>
<p>
  A user account may have the role <strong>admin</strong> which
  permits the account to view and edit almost anything in the system
  via the web interface. This includes:
  <ul>
    <li> Changing ownership of items.</li>
    <li> Creating, editing, deleting and viewing all items.</li>
    <li> Registering, enabling or disabling other user accounts.
  </ul>
</p>
